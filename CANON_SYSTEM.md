# ZoneCount: Canon System

## Overview

The Canon System is built-in institutional knowledge that makes setup fast. Instead of starting from scratch, users can:

1. Identify a zone type (manually or via image recognition)
2. Apply a template with common items pre-populated
3. Tweak: remove items they don't carry, add site-specific items
4. Done in minutes, not hours

This is the product differentiator. Anyone can build scan-and-count. An app that **already knows food service** is the moat.

## Image Recognition Flow

1. User takes photo of storage area
2. App analyzes visual cues:
   - Shelving type (wire vs solid)
   - Temperature indicators (frost, condensation)
   - Product types visible
   - Lighting conditions
3. App suggests zone type with confidence score
4. User confirms or corrects
5. Template items populate with appropriate shelf ordering
6. User customizes and saves

## Onboarding Summary
